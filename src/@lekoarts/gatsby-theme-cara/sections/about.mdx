## About

I'm 28 years old, married and passionate about all kinds of technology. Full-stack web developer with experiences in go, ruby, python and java.
Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Systems, specialized in Software Manager and Software Development with a 7 years experience.

I am a dedicated person who works hard and pays attention to details. I'm flexible, quick to pick up new skills and eager to learn from others. I also have lots of ideas and enthusiasm.

When I am not programming I like to meet my friends, drink some beers and play the piano.
